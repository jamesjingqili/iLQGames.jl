-1. KKT FBNE. 
0. getting gradient. 
1. define merit function. 
2. line search. 

one merit function for forward game: KKT residual for OLNE/FBNE LQ.

one merit function for inverse game: state trajectory prediction loss.
--------------------------------------------
Is it possible that using previous computation and make the computation of the inverse of the KKT matrix more efficient?
